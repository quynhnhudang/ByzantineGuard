    '''
    This is a PyTorch implementation of a BasicBlock module for a ResNet neural network. 
    The BasicBlock module is used to compose the ResNet architecture, 
    which is a deep neural network designed for image classification tasks.

    The BasicBlock module consists of two convolutional layers with batch normalization 
    and ReLU activation, followed by a shortcut connection that adds the input to
     the output of the convolutional layers. The purpose of the shortcut connection is to 
     help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in very deep neural networks. 
     The expansion parameter is used to adjust the number of channels in the shortcut connection 
     if the input and output have different channel sizes.

    The forward method implements the computation of the module.
    The input tensor is first passed through the first convolutional layer, 
    followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. 
    The resulting tensor is then passed through the second convolutional layer, 
    followed by batch normalization. 
    The shortcut tensor is added to the output tensor of the second convolutional layer, 
    and the result is passed through ReLU activation before being returned.

class ResNet(nn.Module):
    '''
    This is a PyTorch implementation of a ResNet neural network for image classification. 
    The ResNet architecture is composed of several building blocks called residual blocks, 
    which are made up of several layers. 
    The ResNet architecture was designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in very deep neural 
    networks.

    The ResNet class takes as input the type of residual block to use (BasicBlock or Bottleneck), 
    the number of blocks for each layer, and the number of classes for the output. 
    The _make_layer method is used to create each layer of the ResNet architecture 
    by stacking multiple residual blocks.

    The forward method implements the computation of the ResNet architecture. 
    The input tensor is first passed through a convolutional layer, 
    followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation.
    The resulting tensor is then passed through the layers of the ResNet architecture,
    which are created using the _make_layer method. The output tensor from the last layer is passed through an average pooling layer, followed by flattening and a linear layer to produce the final output tensor with the number of classes specified in the constructor.

    The ResNet architecture has shown great success in various image classification tasks,
    and is widely used in the computer vision community.
